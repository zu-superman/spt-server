## Features

For a full list of features, please see [FEATURES.md](FEATURES.md).

## Installation

### Requirements

This project has been built in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (VSC) using [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/). We recommend using [NVM](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows) to manage installation and switching Node versions. If you do not wish to use NVM, you will need to install the version of Node.js listed within the `.nvmrc` file manually.

There are a number of VSC extensions that we recommended for this project. VSC will prompt you to install these when you open the workspace file. If you do not see the prompt, you can install them manually:

- [EditorConfig](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=EditorConfig.EditorConfig) - Editor Settings Synchronization
- [Vitest](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vitest.explorer) - Debugging Tests
- [SPT ID Highlighter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=refringe.spt-id-highlighter) - Converts IDs to Names
- [Biome](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=biomejs.biome) - Automatic Formatting & Code Standards Linting

### Initial Setup

To prepare the project for development you will need to:

1. Run `git clone https://github.com/sp-tarkov/server.git server` to clone the repository.
2. Run `git lfs pull` to download LFS files locally.
3. Open the `project/mod.code-workspace` file in Visual Studio Code (VSC).
4. Run `nvm use 22.12.0` in the VSC terminal.
5. Run `npm install` in the VSC terminal.

## Development

### Debugging

To debug the project in Visual Studio Code, you can select the `Run` tab and then select the `Start Debugging` option (or the `F5` shortcut). This will start the server in debug mode, attaching a debugger to code execution, allowing you to set breakpoints and step through the code as it runs.

### Mod Debugging

To debug a server mod in Visual Studio Code, you can copy the mod files into the `user/mods` folder and then start the server in [debug mode](#debugging). You should now be able to set breakpoints in the mod's Typescript files and they will be hit when the server runs the mod files.

## Contributing

We're really excited that you're interested in contributing! Before submitting your contribution, please consider the following:

### Branches

- **master**  
  The default branch used for the latest stable release. This branch is protected and typically is only merged with release branches.
- **3.10.X-DEV**
  Development for the next hotfix release. Hotfix releases include bug fixes and minor features that do not affect the coding structure of the project. Special care is taken to not break server mod stability. These always target the same version of EFT as the last minor release.
- **4.0.0-DEV**
  Development for the next minor release of SPT. Minor releases target the latest version of EFT. Late in the minor release cycle the EFT version is frozen for stability to prepare for release. Larger changes to the project structure may be included in minor releases.

### Pull Request Guidelines

- **Keep Them Small**  
  If you're fixing a bug, try to keep the changes to the bug fix only. If you're adding a feature, try to keep the changes to the feature only. This will make it easier to review and merge your changes.
- **Perform a Self-Review**  
  Before submitting your changes, review your own code. This will help you catch any mistakes you may have made.
- **Remove Noise**  
  Remove any unnecessary changes to white space, code style formatting, or some text change that has no impact related to the intention of the PR.
- **Create a Meaningful Title**  
  When creating a PR, make sure the title is meaningful and describes the changes you've made.
- **Write Detailed Commit Messages**  
  Bring out your table manners, speak the Queen's English and be on your best behaviour.

### Style Guide

We use Biome to enforce a consistent code style. Please run `npm run format` before submitting any changes. This is made easier by opening the VSC workspace and installing the recommended VSC extensions; this will ensure that your code is automatically formatted whenever you save a file.

### Tests

We have a number of tests that are run automatically when you submit a pull request. You can run these tests locally by running `npm run test`. If you're adding a new feature or fixing a bug, please conceder adding tests to cover your changes so that we can ensure they don't break in the future.
